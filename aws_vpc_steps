VPC steps:

1. create vpc - myvpc - 10.0.0.0/16

2. create 2 subnets,  public (webSN) 10.0.1.0/24 and private (DBSN) 10.0.2.0/24

2a. autoassign IPV4 to webSN

3. create internet gateway myIGW and attach VPC myvpc

4. create Route table, myRT

5. RT has 2 ends, attach 1 end to webSN public subnet and other to internet gateway myIGW

6. create web server in public subnet (webSN)

webserver boot strap script:
----------------------------
#!/bin/bash
sudo su
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "MyGOOGLE--1" > index.html
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on

security group:
HTTP  src - 0.0.0.0/0
SSH   src - 0.0.0.0/0

7. create a db server in private subnet (dbSN)

security group:
MYSQL/Aurora  src: 10.0.1.0/24 (public/web subnet)
SSH           src: 10.0.1.41/32 (Bastion server private IP)

8. check if the web server has got the public ip and you can access the webpage from the local browser

9. db server shouldnt have received the public ip as it is in private subnet

10. Now in order to connect to DB server for server maintainance, we need to connect to it via a bastion server (jump server)

11. create a baston server in the public subnet (web SN)

security group:
SSH   src: <my_local_system_ip>

12. ssh to from the local system to the bastion server (10.0.1.x ip range)

13. from the bastion try to access to the db server,
this step fails as the pem file is not present in the bastion server

14. scp the pem file to the bastion server
linux machine:
sudo scp -i bastionKP04.pem ./dbKP04.pem ec2-user@13.236.188.53:/home/ec2-user
win machine:
use win scp and send the file using the public ip of bastion server

15. ssh to the db server as we have the pem file and this tep should pass

16. as we are in the db server, try to install mysql db
yum install mysql -y
this step should fail as there is not internet connection to the db server

17. we use NAT gateway to provide internet to the db server
    create Nat gateway in the public subnet (web SN) and allocate elastic ip address
   
18. attach a route table to this, one end should be connected to the db server and the other end to the nat gateway

19. now try to install mysql in the db server, this step should work

20. to provide additional security to the web subnet we use a Network ACL,
    by default the NACL is deny all traffic and it is stateful,
    so we need to do 2 things,
    a. add additional rules as defined in the security group of the web server
    b. add these rules in both inbound and out bound
   
21. there are ephimeral ports, which needs to be open. add another rule to open ephimeral ports in the NACL (both inbound and outbound)
